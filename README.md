## Welcome to my Portfolio.  

Below is a summation of the 10 projects you will find in this repo.


## 1.  Study of the Texas State Statistics for 2020

This project is a comparison of factors between rural and urban counties:

*  Is there a significant statistical difference between rural and urban single parent households?
*  Are high school graduation rates along with reading and writing scores better in urban schools?
*  Do country people have less health concerns and live longer than city dwellers?

Texas has 254 counties with most of the population in urban counties. The project uses High School Graduation rates, 3rd Grade Math and Reading scores, Physician and uninsured health counts per county, Single parent household percentages, and quality of life factors to include life expectancy, food insecurity, housing cost burdens, poor health indicators, and insufficient sleep rates.

## 2. Cancer EDA 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate several dataframe manipulation methods to include importing data into pandas dataframes using an API, retrieving records from a database, and ingesting flat files. Other dataframe transformation methods include merging two dataframe columns into a single column, converting datatypes, setting default values for NaN values, creating a pivot table, deriving new columns from existing data, and reshaping the dataframe from long to a wide format.

## 3. Chronic Kidney Disease Prevalence and Awareness

The Chronic Kidney Disease project attempts to answer the questions should CKD be included as a major leading cause of death and is the lack of dissemination due to lack of awareness of the disease or the insufficient active monitoring of patients with high risk factors? Data shows that Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is on the rise and affects 1 out 3 adults with diabetes and 1 out of 5 adults with high blood pressure (Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Surveillance System, n.d.-b).  But CKD doesn’t seem to have the same kind of wide-spread attention as diabetes and high blood pressure.

## 4. Neural Networks

The Neural Networks project is a demonstration of using Keras and TensorFlow libraries to build and fit Convolutional Neural Network model, Variational Autoencoder generative model, and a Text generation model using LSTM.

## 5. Computer Network Anomalous Event Correlation.

The objective of this project is to detect anomalous north/south computer network traffic. North/South traffic refer to network communications either originating from within a network to external devices or vice versa. The anomalous traffic is traffic patterns that are outliers from the sample population. The intent of the project is to discover the anomalous traffic with clustering models to group the outliers. Additionally, the project uses the library Anomalize to detect anomalies in time-series data.

## 6. Primate Behavioral Prediction

The Primate Behavioral Prediction project attempts to make predictions using behavioral factors of a group of primates. The questions for the project are:

* Is it possible to predict the sex of the target based upon behaviors?
* Is it possible to predict the dominant male?
* Is it possible to identify sub-groups within the major group of primates?

The project uses network libraries to display the primate interactions and behaviors. Additionally, graphs are created to analyze the behavior counts and the correlations of behaviors with a primate’s sex and number of interactions within the group and sub-groups. Several models are used for the predictions. These models include Logistic Regression, Source Vector Classifier, Ordinal Regression, and Random Forest Classifier. Lastly, the Kmodes clustering model is used to identify sub-groups.

## 7. Recidivism Prediction

The intent of this project is to produce a model capable of predicting the possibility of a convicted person recommitting the same offense or another criminal offense. The study uses a dataset from the Iowa Department of Corrections. This dataset contains recidivism rates and demographics from 2010-2018. The project uses the Random Forest Classifier, Logistics Regression, Naive Bayes, and AdaBoost models.

## 8. Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction

Using the risk factors associated with Chronic Kidney Disease, this project uses 3 different machine learning models to predict the probability of a person being diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease.  The models used for this project include Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, and XgBoost Classifier. 

## 9. Fly or Drive 

The Fly or Drive project is a demonstration of various Data Visualization techniques. The project poses the question “Which is Safer – Flying or Driving”. A comparison of airline versus vehicular travel statistics is the basis for the project with these statistics being displayed in engaging and informative visualization techniques. These techniques include using infographics and area charts comparisons. The objective of the project is to illustrate the safety of flying versus travel by car.

## 10. Predictive Analytics: Healthcare Benefits and Consequences

The Predictive Analytics: Healthcare Benefits and Consequences is a paper that addresses the role that Predictive Analytics has in three of the top deadliest diseases affecting Americans today.  These being Cancer, Alzheimer's, and Heart Disease. The project's objectives are to:

* Identify the positive impacts and contributions of Predictive Analytics in combating these diseases.
* Identify ethical and privacy issues with the prediction of the diseases.

With Electronic Health Records (EHR) being the norm, the likelihood of inadvertent disclosure of this data is an important issue. Even with the most stringent security controls applied to EHR, this does not stop employers, insurers, or other agencies from gaining access to EHR data.
