## Welcome to the my Portfolio.  

Below is a summation of the 10 projects you will find in this repo.


## 1.  Study of the Texas County Health Rankings for 2020

This study aimed to compare factors between rural and urban counties:

*  Is there a significant statistical difference between rural and urban single parent households?
*  Are high school graduation rates along with reading and writing scores better in urban schools?
*  Do country people have less health concerns and live longer than city dwellers?

Texas has 254 counties with most of the population in urban counties. The study uses High School Graduation rates, 3rd Grade Math and Reading scores, Physician and uninsured health counts per county, Single parent household percentages, and quality of lie factors to include life expectancy, food insecurity, housing cost burdens, poor health indicators, and insufficient sleep rates.

## 2. Lung Cancer Study

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate several dataframe manipulation methods to include ingesting files into pandas dataframes using an API. Other dataframe transformation methods include merging two dataframe columns into a single column, converting datatypes, setting default values for NaN values, creating a pivot table, deriving new columns from existing data, and reshaping the dataframe from long to a wide format.

## 3. Chronic Kidney Disease Prevalence and Awareness

The Chronic Kidney Disease study attempts to answer the questions should CKD be included as
a major leading cause of death and is the lack of dissemination due to lack of awareness of the
disease or the insufficient active monitoring of patients with high risk factors? Data shows that
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is on the rise and affects 1 out 3 adults with diabetes and 1 out of
5 adults with high blood pressure (Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Surveillance System, n.d.-b).
But CKD doesn’t seem to have the same kind of wide-spread attention as diabetes and high
blood pressure.

## 4. Text Generation

The Text Generation project ingests a text file and generates new text from the existing corpus. The project uses Keras libraries to pre-process the text file, create sequences to input into the Keras model, trains the model, and has the model generate new text.

## 5. Computer Network Traffic Anomalies

The objective of this project is to detect anomalous north/south computer network traffic. North/South traffic refer to network communications either originating from within a network to external devices or vice versa. The anomalous traffic is traffic patterns that are outliers from the sample population. The intent of the project is not to discover the type of anomalous traffic but to use clustering models to group the outliers and to use the library Anomalize to detect anomalies in time-series data.

## 6. Primate Behavioral Prediction

The Primate Behavioral Prediction Study attempted to predict the certain factors based upon behaviors of a group of primates. The questions for the study are:

* Is it possible to predict the sex of the target based upon behaviors?
* Is it possible to predict the dominant male?
* Is it possible to identify sub-groups within the major group of primates?

The study uses network libraries to display the primate interactions and behaviors. Additionally, graphs are created to analyze the behavior counts and the correlations of behaviors with a primate’s sex and number of interactions within the group and sub-groups. Several models are used for the predictions. These models include Logistic Regression, Source Vector Classifier, Ordinal Regression, and Random Forest Classifier. Lastly, the Kmodes clustering model is used to identify sub-groups.

## 7. Recidivism Prediction

The intent of this study is to produce a model capable of predicting the possibility of a
convicted person recommitting the same offense or another criminal offense. The study uses a
dataset from the Iowa Department of Corrections. This dataset contains recidivism rates and
demographics from 2010-2018. After cleaning the data and conducting feature selection, the
final dataset was used as input to three different models. The models are Random Forest,
Logistics Regression, Naive Bayes, and AdaBoost.

## 8. Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction

Using the risk factors associated with Chronic Kidney Disease, this project uses 3 different machine learning models to predict the possibility of a person being diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease.  The models usd for this study include Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, and XgBoost Classifier. 

## 9. Fly or Drive Study

The Fly or Drive Study is a demonstration of various Data Visualization techniques. The study poses the question “Which is Safer – Flying or Driving”. A comparison of airline versus vehicular travel statistics is the basis for the study with these statistics being displayed in engaging and informative visualization techniques. These techniques include using infographics and area charts comparisons. The objective of the study is to illustrate the safety of flying versus travel by car.
