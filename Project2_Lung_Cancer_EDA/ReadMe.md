### Lung Cancer EDA Project
											
											
This is the ReadMe file for the Lung Cancer EDA project.  The purpose of the project is to use an API to
	retrieve the data and employ various Pandas dataframe reshaping methods to aggregate fields and compute
	values for new columns.  The code is written in Python 3.8 and Pandas library modules.  The code is embedded
	in a Jupyter Notebook.  The code is stored in the file with the .pynb suffix and a copy fo the notebook is exported
	to a Pdf file.
