The purpose of this study is to demonstrate several dataframe manipulation methods to include ingesting files into pandas dataframes using an API. Other dataframe transformation methods include merging two dataframe columns into a single column, converting datatypes, setting default values for NaN values, creating a pivot table, deriving new columns from existing data, and reshaping the dataframe from long to a wide format.

The code is written in Python version 3.8 and uses the Pandas libraries to manipulate the dataframes.
