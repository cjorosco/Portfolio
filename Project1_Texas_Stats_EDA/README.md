![Texas_Flag]()

### Objective:

The Texas Statistics EDA project explores the State of Texas 2020 Health and Demographic Statistics. The objective for the EDA is to answer the following questions:

* Is there a significant statistical difference between rural single parent households and urban single parent households?
* Are High School Graduation rates and 3rd Grade Reading and Math scores better in urban schools than rural schools?
* Is there a difference between life expectancy and poor health, lack of sleep, no insurance, housing costs, access to food, and
 availability of doctors in urban areas than rural areas?
 
Texas has 254 counties yet most of the population is concentrated in Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, Houston area, and San Antonio. The project explores and analyzes the differences in High School Graduation rates, Single Parent, Households, and Quality of Life Factors for Rural verus Metropolitan Households. 

### Results:

The results show:

* No significant difference between Rural and Urban areas
* Urban schools have a slightly higher 3rd reading level
* Both areas have a 98% graduation rate
* One reason for high graduation rate is standardized testing and a push to pass the test.
* According to the results Rural schools are just as good as Urban schools when it comes to
  high school graduation, Math and Reading levels.
* No outliers were detected
