### Objective:

Data shows that Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is on the rise and affects 1 out 3 adults with diabetes and 1 out of 5 adults with high blood pressure (Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Surveillance System, n.d.-b). But CKD doesn’t seem to have the same kind of wide-spread attention as diabetes and high blood pressure. With the progression of CKD comes worsening health problems that go beyond those of just diabetes and heart disease. The CDC claims that heart disease is the leading cause of death for people aged 45 and older (Heart Disease | cdc.gov, 2022). Therefore, the Chronic Kidney Disease Prevalence and Awareness EDA project atttempts to answer the following:

* Should Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) be considered a major leading caus of death considering the population increase in diabetes and hypertension which themselves are the 2 leading contributors to CKD.
* What are the prevalence and awareness levels of CKD in the general population?
* What is the reason, if any, for the disparity between the prevalence level and awareness level?

### Results:

The project is an analysis of several datasets to include data files from the CDC Surveillance System, (Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Surveillance System, n.d.-b), datasets fromt he CDC Stats by States, (NCHS Pressroom - Stats of the States, n.d.), CDC National Health Center Statistics (NHANES - About the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, n.d.), Comorbidity in Chronic Kidney Disease (MacRae et al., 2020), and Trends in Referral Patterns to Nephrologists (Ghimire et al., 2022).  The project consists of an analysis of the prevalence and awareness levels predominately using the data from the NHANES dataset.  The Diabetes prevalences show an increase of 2.5% from 2009 - 2020. Whereas Hypertension rates have increased by 3.7 percent during the same timeframe. As for CKD, using the All-Stages values, there has been an increase of 12 percent from 2009 – 2020. For Stage 4 (eGFR 15-29) there has been an increase of 12 percent from 2009 – 2020 by itself. There a 5 stages of CKD, with Stage 5 indicating the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant.
